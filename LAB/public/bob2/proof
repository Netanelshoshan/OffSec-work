- Found that ports 80,21,3389 was open.
- Did some digging and found that the web server was had iis vulnrabillity ".asp upload" so i used it to gain a low priv shell.
- For privesc I didn't find anything that will work on the winXP SP1 .. except for the "upnphost" service that I mitigated to gain my system 
-- privilages by setting the bin path to the service to execute "netcat" that was uploaded with the ftp server that was also vulnerable to anonymous loggin
-- and got a reverse shell with system privilages.
