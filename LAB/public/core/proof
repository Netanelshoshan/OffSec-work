# Enumeration:
# The first scan revealed ports 80,22 and after a deep scan found also a http port on 10443 but wasn't so helpful.
# Found that the target use WordPress v3.5.1 , used cewl to generate a password file. 
# Used Wpscan to found the correct Password for the admin page 'princess'.

# Exploiting:
# Used MSF module (wp_admin_shell_upload) to use the correct creds to gain a reverse shell.
# The payload that I choose was a generic custom payload that was used to gain a <Reverse PHP shell> using nc.

# Post-Exploitation:
# Got dumb shell without tty and bearly interactive. Used python to import bash and then I fixed the tty.
# I found that the kernel version that was running on the machine was vulnerable (2.6.32)
