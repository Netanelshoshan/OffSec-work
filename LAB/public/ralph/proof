- Initial scan revealed ports 80,135,139,445,1925,1433,3389.
- Scanning for vulns showed me that the host was vulnerable to MS17-10.
- I've tried not to use the msf option but after one day of researching, I decided to continue the research later.
- Got super duper cool exploit and she's ready to be fired up on Windows server 2008/7/8 and up :)
- Didn't need any moves to get privesc because the exploit gave my straight system privilages. 
- So.. that's it.. cool! bye ..
